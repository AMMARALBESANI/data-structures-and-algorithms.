# Tree Intersection Challenge

## Problem Domain

In this coding challenge, the goal is to find the intersection of values between two binary trees. Given two binary trees, we want to identify the values that exist in both trees. This challenge requires implementing a function called `tree_intersection` that takes two binary trees as parameters and returns a set of values that are common to both trees.


## Efficiency

Efficiency is an important consideration when solving this problem. Here are some efficiency considerations:

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of your solution should be as efficient as possible. Avoid unnecessary operations that could lead to a high time complexity, especially when traversing the trees.

- **Space Complexity**: Consider the space complexity of your solution. Do you need to store the entire tree or can you work with a single set to track common values? Minimizing unnecessary memory usage is important.

- **Algorithm Choice**: Think about the choice of data structures and algorithms for your solution. Can you optimize your solution by using hash sets, hash maps, or other data structures?
