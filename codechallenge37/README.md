Problem Domain:
The problem domain for this task involves determining whether a business trip itinerary is possible with direct flights using Alaska Airlines' route map and calculating the total cost if it is possible. You are given a graph where cities represent nodes, and the direct flight routes between cities represent edges with associated costs. The task is to find out if a given itinerary of cities can be traveled in a sequence of direct flights and, if so, calculate the total cost of the trip.

Efficiency Analysis:
Let's analyze the efficiency of the businessTrip function and the underlying algorithm in terms of time and space complexity:

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of cities (nodes) in the itinerary.
In the worst case, the algorithm iterates through the entire itinerary to check if there are direct flights between consecutive cities and accumulate the total cost.
The cost lookup for each city pair is done in constant time O(1) since it uses a dictionary.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), which is constant space.
The space used does not depend on the size of the itinerary or the graph but only on a few variables and data structures used within the function.
