Problem Domain:
The problem domain involves working with graphs to perform depth-first traversal on a graph. In this domain, you have a `Node` class representing individual nodes in the graph, and a `Graph` class for working with a collection of nodes.

- `Node` class: Each node has a `Value` property to store its value (in this case, a string), and a `Neighbors` property to maintain a list of neighboring nodes. The neighbors represent the nodes that are directly connected to the current node.

- `Graph` class: This class is responsible for managing a collection of nodes. It provides a `DepthFirst` method that performs depth-first traversal starting from a given node. The method uses a stack-based approach to traverse the graph.

Efficiency:

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of depth-first traversal in a graph using a stack is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph, and E is the number of edges. This is because each node and edge are visited once.

- Space Complexity: The space complexity of the depth-first traversal using a stack is O(V), where V is the number of vertices. This space is used to store the visited nodes and the stack for traversal.

The code efficiently performs depth-first traversal by using a stack to keep track of nodes to visit. It avoids recursive calls and ensures that each node and edge is visited exactly once, making it a suitable approach for traversing large graphs.
