Problem Domain:
The problem domain for this task is to implement the "breadth first" traversal algorithm for a graph data structure. The graph is represented using nodes and edges, where each node has a value and a list of neighboring nodes. The goal is to traverse the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from a given node, and return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited.

Efficiency Analysis:
Let's analyze the efficiency of the implemented breadth-first traversal algorithm in terms of time and space complexity:

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of breadth-first traversal is O(n + E), where n is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph, and E is the number of edges.
In the worst case, every node and edge in the graph is visited once. The algorithm visits each node and examines all its neighbors.
Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the breadth-first traversal is O(n), where n is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph.
This space is used to store the visited nodes and the queue for the breadth-first traversal.
In the worst case, when all nodes are visited, the space required is proportional to the number of nodes in the graph.
